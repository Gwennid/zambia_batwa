# f4 ratio test

These are results of the f4 ratio to test admixture from the Batwa from Uganda and the Sabue from Ethiopia (code: `code/f4ratio.sh`).

The outputs were modified manually to include only relevant columns for plotting. Corresponding files are `results/revisions_NatureCommunication/f4ratio/f4ratio_eRHGadmixture_Batwa_anc3apes` and `results/revisions_NatureCommunication/f4ratio/f4ratio_eHGadmixture_Sabue_anc3apes`.

The ratio were plotted with R (code: `main/code/plot_f4ratio.R`). The resulting figure is `main/results/revisions_NatureCommunication/f4ratio/20230710_f4ratio_test_rRHG-Batwa_eHG-Sabue_ancestry_in15pop20230703.pdf`.

Correlations between estimates made with different source populations were calculated in `main/code/plot_f4ratio.R`.

The estimated admixture fractions for the five Zambian populations were written out in `main/code/plot_f4ratio.R`.
