The file "summary_531ind_2500run" containing ancestry fractions for the Omni1 dataset, for each for a hundred sets and 25 repeats of ADMIXTURE, is not included due to its size. It can be made available upon request.

The [PCA](zbatwa8_zbantu8_Schlebusch7_KGP8_Patin8_1-22_5fex_PC1to6_20210121.pdf) is a quality check to verify that the dataset prepared for the X to autosome ancestry ratio is comparable to the Omni1 autosomal dataset. Only the autosomes were used for this PCA.
