## Reviewers' suggestions (Nature Communication, May 2023)

See detailed list here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1inscyyqnBAOLQqxBt7nqAnn5EemPRPEfkv3cfkEa8N8/edit#gid=0

- [ ] ADMIXTURE cross-validation error
- [ ] Search for the best fit admixture graph with the find_graphs function of ADMIXTOOLS
- [ ] Run f4 tests. This is where the outgroup matters. Similar to the f3, for example Yoruba-Juhoansi.
- [ ] Explain better the f4 ratio tests
- [ ] Comment on the mRNA results

### Analysis where the Baka are replaced by the Batwa from Uganda:

Start with the analyses where the Baka can be easily swapped for the Batwa, for example the f3.

- [ ] Projected PCA (figure 1C) with Batwa
- [ ] ADMIXTURE proportions (figures 2 and 5)
- [ ] f4 ratio test (figure 3)
- [ ] f3 (table S4)
- [ ] MOSAIC. I'm not sure what the reviewer wants to see here. Check that the Batwa were included for the "unsupervised" analyses. We can run analysis where we force the Batwa to be the minor source. Perhaps it's enough to say it was a free analysis and the Batwa were included. Does one get more than the top 5 populations? -> check it out (especially relative positions of Baka and Batwa)

### Analyses where the Hadza are replaced by the Sabue

- [ ] f4 ratio test (figure 3)
- [ ] f3 (table S4)
